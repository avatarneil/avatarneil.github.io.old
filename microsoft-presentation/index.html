# Introduction
## Who am I, and why should you want to work with me?

* First name Charles, middle name Neil.
 * I go by Neil
* I graduated from Friends' Central School in 2017
* Interned at Gravic as a SWE for some of the spring and the summer of 2017
* Attended UMass Boston for a year
 * Spring semester I also worked at Zipcar in Boston as a co-op full time
 * PSA: Working 40hrs a week as a SWE and trying to be enrolled in school full time is a **bad idea**
* Worked at Zipcar in San Mateo as a Firmware Engineering Intern
* Transferred to Boston University and continued working at Zipcar as a contractor(ish) part time

* Participated in tons of clubs/orgs
 * Was in the school's Makerspace for hours each day
 * Stage Crew Captain

# Prior Work Experience
* Tutoring/Camp Counselor
* Gravic Inc. -- Spring/Summer 2017 -- SWE Intern
* Zipcar -- Spring 2018 - Present -- QA Engineering Co-op -> Firmware Engineering Intern -> ?

# Prior Work Experience
## Tutoring/Camp Counselor

---
# Prior Work Experience
## Gravic Inc.

* Hired as part of my high school Senior Project
* Was tasked with finishing a GUI front-end using C# for configuring Oracle Databases
 * Sounds super cool, I know!
* Finished way too early, work was not scoped well
* Was put in the experimental position of re-writing the entire program as a web app and wrapping it in Electron!
* Hired as an intern for the summer, finished the full re-write with lots of pretty animations
* Unfortunately I can't show any of it :'(

---
# Prior Work Experience
## Zipcar Inc. 
* Was hired as a QA Engineering Co-op for Spring 2018
* Part of the Telematics team
 * _Cough_ Sorry, what's Telematics?
 * You know how for some cars report telemetry data to a server (On-Star, Tesla, etc)? Or how when you tap on a Zipcar it *magically* knows to open itself for you? That's Telematics!
* For about 5 months, my primary job was...
 * Running Regression Tests
 * Monitoring test vehicles and paid-beta vehicles in Boston and Providence markets
 * Monitoring test releases
 * Assigning tickets on JIRA. So... so many tickets

---
# Prior Work Experience
## Zipcar (Continued?!)
* Before the end of my 6 month co-op, was offered an internship in California writing the firmware I'd spent months breaking!
* Packed my bags, flew over, and immediately started working on writing an emulator for our firmware so we wouldn't need to buy excessive black-boxes for testing.
* Finished the project, at the end we discovered it wasn't financially feasible (who knew emulating cycle correct processors is super inefficient?)
* Started working on the production firmware used in Zipcars, as part of a replatforming movement.
* Am now the primary maintainer of the firmware used in the majority of the Zipcar fleet
* Fun stuff I've done at work recently
 * Rewrote log compression/uploading
 * Worked on lots of bugfixes
 * Worked directly with product to groom tickets for new features
 * Provided 24/7 support for our coast to coast testing fleet
 * Aided in development of our next-gen hardware/firmware

# Hackathons
## HackHarvard 2018
* Developed Surround as part of a team of 3
 * Surround was an iOS application that queried HealthKit data to determine the user's "sleep state"
 * Emitted IFTTT triggers to enable IOT interaction based upon sleep
 * Turn on your security system
 * Set lights to red hue so you don't burn your eyes when you wake up for midnight snacks
 * And it's all automatic!
* I did almost all of the iOS development and integration for our app in Swift, a language I'd never touched before
* Unfortunately, we didn't place, but it was a great learning experience!
---
# Hackathons
## BostonHacks 2018
* Developed Coffee-Bot as part of a team of 5
 * Purpose: Internet enabled coffee for the masses
 * IOT Coffee machines are expensive! We designed a platform that could feasibly be built for ~$35. 
 * You could set an alarm via the web-app to brew your coffee 10 mins before it goes off, mmm fresh coffee...
 * You could call/text your coffee machine using Twilio API integration, and have it immediately brew you a pot!
* I worked in Ruby, Python, C, and with lots of wires/servos for this project. My primary job was system's integration.
* We won best IOT Qualcomm Hack @ BostonHacks! Woot!

# Personal Projects
## Currently Public
* Open-sourced multiple libraries on the Zipcar Github for exposing PIC emulated chips to external peripherals using IPC!
* Worked on multiple Hardware Abstraction Layer Crates in Rust
 * LPC177x_8x, handful of STM32's
 * Currently implementing Flash traits
* Dashing-Caltrain -- A widget for the Dashing Dashboard framework to display Caltrain arrival/departure times
* Surround and Coffee-bot
* Lots of other tiny projects on my github... github.com/avatarneil

---
# Personal Projects
## Coming soon...
* Ocean, a totally cross-platform package manager for installing binaries. Windows, Linux, MacOS; you name it, we've got it.
 * Written entirely in Rust
 * Planned UI (nothing yet, but we're working on it!)
 * v0.0.1 ETA Q1 2019
 * Will be open source once the team decides on a license
