    <div id="about">
        <p> I began my foray into the land of Computer Science at the age of 10, when I purchased my first laptop. After spending
            many hours meticulously configuring my Ubuntu environment on my laptop (I didn't stick to Windows XP for long!),
            I discovered that I had a passion for what I was doing. I started learning basic web development tools, such
            as HTML and CSS, and then started trying my hand at writing code for chips that supported the Arduino platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout high-school, I took courses focusing on Processing, Java, and Haskell; this deepened my understanding of fundamental
            computing principles. I participated in multiple project-driven mathematical modeling competitions as the primary
            programmer for my team, and we received national recognition for our papers, as well as increased funding from
            our school's math department. I interned at Gravic Inc. and furthered by knowledge by crash-coursing C#, and
            writing an Electron application that required in-depth full stack knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            I began studying CS as an undergrad at UMass Boston, taking courses specializing in introductory Python, Data Structures,
            and Algorithms. During my time at UMass, I accepted a position as a QA Engineering Co-op at Zipcar in Boston,
            MA. Towards the end of my co-op, I was offered a continuing position as an Embedded Software Engineering Intern,
            at Zipcar in San Mateo, where I am currently developing an emulator for our in-house firmware solution for Telematics
            units. This fall, I am transferring to Boston University, with the intention to complete my undergraduate degree
            in Computer Science, and begin pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science, with a focus on Machine Learning.
